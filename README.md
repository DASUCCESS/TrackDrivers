### **TrackDriver - Intelligent Trip Management System**
**TrackDriver** is a full-stack trip management system designed to help drivers efficiently plan their trips, track fuel stops, and generate **FMCSA-compliant daily logs**. The system utilizes **React (Frontend)** and **Django (Backend)**, integrating **Mapbox API** for real-time route visualization and automated trip calculations.

---

## **Features**
### **Frontend (React - `tripui/`)**
- **Modern UI with React Bootstrap Styling**  
- **Location Autocomplete**: Users can select current, pickup, and drop-off locations dynamically.  
- **Interactive Map with Mapbox**:
  - **Route visualization** on an interactive map.
  - **Fuel stop & rest stop markers** labeled with location names.
  - **Pickup & drop-off locations** clearly displayed.  
- **Real-time Trip Calculations**:
  - **Total Distance & Duration Calculation**.
  - **Automated Fuel & Rest Stop Calculation**.
  - **Generated Driving Logs** for each trip daily and multiple dailly log if .  

### **Backend (Django - `tripbackend/`)**
- **RESTful API built with Django Rest Framework (DRF)**.  
- **Trip Calculation Logic**:
  - Fetches route details from **Mapbox Directions API**.
  - Calculates **fuel stops**, **rest stops**, and **estimated trip time**.
  - **Reverse geocoding** to fetch real-world location names.  
- **ELD (Electronic Logging Device) Logs Generation**:
  - Daily logs with **driving hours, on-duty hours, off-duty hours, and sleeper hours**.  
- **Database Storage (PostgreSQL Recommended)**.
- **Environment Variables for Secure API Keys**.

### **How the Trip Logging Application Works (Real-Life Example)**  

Let's say **John**, a truck driver, is hired to **transport goods** from **Houston, Texas**, to **New York City**. He needs to follow FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) rules, track his journey, log fuel stops, and rest stops.

---

### **Step-by-Step Process in the App**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ John Enters Trip Details**
John opens the application and **fills out the trip form** with:  
- **Current Location:** Houston, TX  
- **Pickup Location:** Chicago, IL  
- **Dropoff Location:** New York, NY  
- **Current Cycle Used (Hours):** 5 hours already used  

 **He clicks "Submit Trip"**, and the backend processes his trip.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ App Calculates the Route**
Once John submits, the system **fetches the best driving route** using **Mapbox API**.  

It calculates:  
‚úÖ **Total Distance:** 1,874 miles  
‚úÖ **Estimated Driving Time:** 32.07 hours  
‚úÖ **Fuel Stops Required:** 1 (Refuel every 1,000 miles)  
‚úÖ **Rest Stops Required:** 4 (Must rest after 8 hours of driving)  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ App Logs the Trip & Generates Daily Log Sheets**
John‚Äôs trip will take multiple days, so the system **creates a log for each driving day**.

Example of logs:
| **Date**     | **Driving Hours** | **On Duty Hours** | **Off Duty Hours** | **Sleeper Hours** |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 2025-03-16 | 11 hours         | 14 hours        | 10 hours        | 0 hours        |
| 2025-03-17 | 11 hours         | 14 hours        | 10 hours        | 0 hours        |
| 2025-03-18 | 10.07 hours      | 13.07 hours     | 10 hours        | 0 hours        |

‚úÖ **On each day**, John‚Äôs driving, rest, and duty hours are tracked automatically based on FMCSA rules.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Displaying the Route on the Map**
Once the trip is created, **the map displays**:
- **Start Location** (Houston, TX)   
- **Pickup Point** (Chicago, IL)   
- **Dropoff Point** (New York, NY)   
- **Fuel Stops** (e.g., Indianapolis, IN)   
- **Rest Stops** (e.g., Columbus, OH)   

**John can now visually see his full trip route with all required stops!**

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Checking Past Trips & Logs**
Later, John wants to review his previous trips. He can:
‚úÖ **View all past trips** (`GET /api/trips/`)  
‚úÖ **Check a specific trip‚Äôs details & logs** (`GET /api/trips/{id}/`)  

If John selects a trip, he sees:
- **Trip distance, estimated time, and stop locations**  
- **All logs for each driving day**  
- **A full route map with all stops**

---

### **Real-Life Benefits**
üîπ **John follows FMCSA rules automatically** (No manual logbook needed).  
üîπ **Rest & fuel stops are optimized for efficiency.**  
üîπ **The company can track past trips & driver logs.**  
üîπ **Less risk of violations due to incorrect logging.**
